        A burger is a popular and versatile sandwich typically consisting of a ground meat patty—most commonly beef—served inside a sliced bun. Often grilled or pan-fried, the patty is accompanied by a variety of toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, cheese, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. Burgers can be customized with additional ingredients like bacon, avocado, fried eggs, or specialty sauces, making them a favorite comfort food across the globe. Whether enjoyed at a fast-food joint or a gourmet restaurant, the burger remains an iconic and satisfying meal that appeals to a wide range of tastes.
