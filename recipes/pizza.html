        Pizza is a beloved Italian dish that features a round, flat dough base topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of toppings, then baked to create a crispy, flavorful crust. Common toppings include pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, and bell peppers, though endless combinations allow for personal creativity and regional styles. From the thin, crispy crust of a New York-style slice to the deep-dish richness of Chicago-style pizza, it comes in many forms. Pizza is enjoyed worldwide for its delicious taste, shareable nature, and ability to suit nearly any preference, making it a go-to food for casual meals, celebrations, and gatherings.

        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness, typically about 12 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper or a floured pizza peel for easy transfer to the oven.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of toppings, distributing them evenly across the pizza.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let it cool for a minute, then garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Slice and serve hot!</li>
