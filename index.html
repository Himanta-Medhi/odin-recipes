    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich, savory fillings such as seasoned ground meat, tomato sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. Baked to perfection, it features a golden, bubbling top and a hearty, flavorful interior. Lasagna is known for its comforting, indulgent nature and is often served at family gatherings or special occasions. Variations exist around the world, including vegetarian versions with spinach and ricotta or regional twists with different meats and sauces. Its layered structure and rich taste make it a beloved staple in Italian cuisine.
